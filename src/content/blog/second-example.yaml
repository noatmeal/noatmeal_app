# Example with a different structure
title: "Second Example Post"
publishDate: "2025-04-06" # Different key name for date
author: "AI Assistant"
body: |
  This post demonstrates a slightly different YAML structure.
  It uses 'publishDate' instead of 'date' and 'body' instead of 'content'.
  The corresponding component `SecondExample.tsx` needs to handle these keys.

  - It can include lists.
  - Or other Markdown-like elements if the component supports rendering them.
