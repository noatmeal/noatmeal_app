    This demonstrates handling nested data structures within the YAML.
    The component `ThirdExample.tsx` will need to access `meta.publication_date` 
    and `mainContent.introduction`.
  sections:
    - heading: "Section 1"
      text: "Content for the first section."
    - heading: "Section 2"
      text: "Content for the second section, showing a list of items."
      items:
        - "Item A"
        - "Item B"
