            I've had several different ambitions over the past seven years
            or so of my life. Among the ones that stick around in my head, 
            I've wanted to:

                  Make a proof assistant so that I could understand
                  mathematical proofs at a deeper level.
              - Create a dependently typed programming language.

                  Create text based games with a dependently typed programming 
                  language and then explore that game's "world" with the 
                  type/proof system of that language.

            My undergraduate and master's studies centered on mathematics with 
            a minor in computer science which caused me to fall just short of 
            taking courses on computer science theory and compilers.

                    I really wish I prioritized taking these courses 
                    because understanding how to implement the machines 
                    that can recognize languages in the

                    is a total blindspot in my education and it's 
                    necessary for every single one of my ambitions listed 
                    above.

                    Not too long ago I picked up the first edition of 
                    "Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and 
                    Computation" by John E. Hopcroft and Jeffry D. Ullman which
                    is sometimes referred to as the "

            It has the material that I need to learn and so that's where my 
            focus is going to be for the next several blog posts. I'm hoping to
            develop these basic machines that recognize languages in Scheme, a 
            language that I have a passing familiarity with but would enjoy 
            more exposure to.
