        I've had several different ambitions over the past seven years
        or so of my life. Among the ones that stick around in my head, 
        I've wanted to:

              Make a proof assistant so that I could understand
              mathematical proofs at a deeper level.
          - Create a dependently typed programming language.

              Create text based games with a dependently typed programming 
              language and then explore that game's "world" with the type/proof 
              system of that language.
          - parts:
              - Understand concepts like

        My undergraduate and master's studies centered on mathematics with a minor 
        in computer science. So I fell just short of taking a solid introduction 
        course to computer science theory and I also never took a good compiler 
        course.

                Two classes I really wish I was forced to take in hindsight, 
                because understanding and knowing how to implement the machines that 
                can recognize languages in the

                are total blindspots in my education and these blindspots are 
                necessary for every single one of my ambitions listed above.

                Not too long ago I picked up the first edition of 
                "Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation" by 
                John E. Hopcroft and Jeffry D. Ullman which is sometimes 
                referred to as the "

        It has the material that I need to learn and so that's where my focus is
        going to be for the next several blog posts. I'm hoping to develop these
        basic machines that recognize languages in Scheme, a language that I 
        have a passing familiarity with but would enjoy more exposure to.
