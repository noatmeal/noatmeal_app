    I've had several different ambitions over the past seven years
    or so of my life. Among the ones that stick around in my head, I've wanted 
    to:
listOfWants:
  firstWant: 
    content: >
      Make a proof assistant so that I could understand
      mathematical proofs at a deeper level.
  secondWant: 
    content: "Create a dependently typed programming language."
  thirdWant: 
    content: >
      Create text based games with a dependently typed programming language and 
      then explore that game's "world" with the type/proof system of that 
      language. 
  fourthWant: 
    content: 
      sentence: 
        firstPart: "Understand concepts like "
        secondPart: 
          content: "the Lambda Cube"

        finalPart: "."
secondParagraph: 
  content: >
    My undergraduate and master's studies centered on mathematics with a minor 
    in computer science. So I fell just short of taking a solid introduction 
    course to computer science theory and I also never took a good compiler 
    course. Two classes I really wish I was forced to take in hindsight because 
    understanding and knowing how to implement the machines that can recognize 
    languages in the Chomsky Hierarchy are total blindspots in my education and 
    these blindspots are necessary for every single one of my ambitions listed 
    above.
